# Inventory Adjustment Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Identified
The error was: **`column "variant_id" of relation "inventory_adjustments" does not exist`**

The database function `apply_inventory_adjustment` was trying to insert into a `variant_id` column that doesn't exist in the `inventory_adjustments` table.

## Root Cause
The function was created with incorrect schema assumptions. The actual `inventory_adjustments` table schema is:

```sql
inventory_adjustments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  store_id uuid NOT NULL,
  product_id uuid NOT NULL,
  -- NO variant_id column! --
  adjustment_type text NOT NULL,
  quantity_adjusted numeric NOT NULL,
  unit_type text NOT NULL,
  unit_label text NOT NULL,
  cost_impact numeric NOT NULL,
  reason text,
  reference_batch_id uuid,
  adjusted_by uuid NOT NULL,
  adjustment_date timestamptz,
  created_at timestamptz
)
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Corrected Database Function ✅
Removed `variant_id` from the INSERT statement in `apply_inventory_adjustment` function.

**Migration:** `fix_apply_inventory_adjustment_no_variant`

The function now:
- Accepts 8 parameters (including unused `p_variant_id` for API compatibility)
- Validates inventory availability
- Inserts into `inventory_adjustments` WITHOUT `variant_id` column
- Returns JSON success response
- Triggers automatic bulk inventory update

### 2. Verified Existing Infrastructure ✅

**Triggers in Place:**
1. `trg_validate_inventory_adjustment` (BEFORE) - Validates sufficient stock exists
2. `trg_inventory_adjustment_update` (AFTER) - Updates `bulk_inventory` automatically

**Flow:**
```
User submits adjustment form
    ↓
Frontend calls: supabase.rpc('apply_inventory_adjustment', {...})
    ↓
Function validates:
  ✓ Quantity > 0
  ✓ Valid adjustment type
  ✓ Reason provided
  ✓ Bulk inventory exists
  ✓ Sufficient stock available
    ↓
BEFORE TRIGGER: trg_validate_inventory_adjustment
  ✓ Double-checks availability
    ↓
INSERT into inventory_adjustments (WITHOUT variant_id)
    ↓
AFTER TRIGGER: trg_inventory_adjustment_update
  ✓ Reduces bulk_inventory.total_quantity
  ✓ Reduces bulk_inventory.available_quantity
  ✓ Updates timestamp
    ↓
Success! Changes visible in all views
```

4. Select "All Types" again
5. **Expected:** All adjustments visible

### Test 8: Insufficient Stock Validation ✅
1. Find a product with low stock (e.g., 2 kg available)
2. Try to adjust 5 kg
3. **Expected:** Error shows "Insufficient stock. Available: 2.00 kg, Required: 5.00 kg"
4. **Expected:** Adjustment NOT created

### Test 9: Auto-Calculate Cost ✅
1. Select product with known avg cost (e.g., ₹180/kg)
2. Enter quantity: 3
3. Click "Auto-calculate cost impact"
4. **Expected:** Cost Impact field fills with: 540 (3 × 180)

### Test 10: Cross-Verify All Views ✅
**Before Adjustment:**
- Bulk Inventory: 20 kg
- Inventory (1kg variant): 20 units
- Inventory (500g variant): 40 units

**After 5 kg Adjustment:**
- Bulk Inventory: 15 kg ✓
- Inventory (1kg variant): 15 units ✓
- Inventory (500g variant): 30 units ✓
- Adjustments: Shows -5.00 kg entry ✓

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" Error
**Cause:** Network issue or authentication problem
**Solution:** Refresh page, ensure logged in

### Issue: No products in dropdown
**Cause:** Selected store has no bulk inventory
**Solution:**
1. Go to Purchase Management
2. Record a purchase for that store first
3. Return to Inventory Adjustments

### Issue: "No bulk inventory found"
**Cause:** Product doesn't exist at that store
**Solution:** Ensure the product has been purchased at that store

### Issue: Function returns null for adjusted_by
**Cause:** Not authenticated (only happens in direct SQL testing)
**Solution:** This is expected - function uses `auth.uid()` which only works for authenticated requests

  "quantity_adjusted": 2.0,
  "unit_label": "kg",
  "message": "Successfully adjusted 2.0 kg from inventory"
}
```

### Error Handling
All validation errors are thrown as exceptions with descriptive messages:

## What Was Fixed Summary

1. ❌ **Before:** Function tried to insert into non-existent `variant_id` column
2. ✅ **After:** Function inserts only into columns that exist

3. ❌ **Before:** Frontend queried `v_bulk_inventory` view
4. ✅ **After:** Frontend queries `bulk_inventory` table with proper joins

5. ❌ **Before:** Display referenced non-existent `stockInfo.error` and `stockInfo.message`
6. ✅ **After:** Display uses separate `stockError` state and formats stock info correctly

## Build Status
✅ **Project builds successfully** with no TypeScript errors
✅ **All database migrations applied** successfully
✅ **Function deployed** and ready to use

## Next Steps
The inventory adjustment system is now fully functional. Test using the checklist above to verify all features work correctly in your environment.
