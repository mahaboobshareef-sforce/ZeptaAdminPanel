# RBAC Implementation Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Empty Sidebar Navigation
**Problem**: The sidebar was showing no menu items even for admin users.

**Root Cause**:
- The `useAuth` hook was hardcoding the role as `'admin'` instead of fetching it from the database
- The `usePermissions` hook was using `user` (Supabase auth user without role) instead of `profile` (database user with role)

**Solution**:
1. Updated `useAuth` to fetch actual user profile from database using `supabase.from('users').select('*').eq('id', session.user.id).maybeSingle()`
2. Changed `usePermissions` to use `profile` instead of `user`
3. Added loading state in App.tsx to wait for profile to load before rendering layout

### Issue 2: Logout Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking logout button did nothing.

**Root Cause**: The signOut function wasn't properly clearing all state and redirecting.

**Solution**:
Updated `signOut` function to:
- Clear profile state
- Clear user state
- Clear session state
- Redirect to home page after successful logout

### Issue 3: Query Error with .single()
**Problem**: Using `.single()` throws error when no user found.

**Solution**: Changed to `.maybeSingle()` which returns null instead of throwing error when no rows match.

## Files Modified

1. **src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
   - Fetch user profile from database on auth
   - Use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()`
   - Properly clear all state on logout
   - Redirect after logout

2. **src/hooks/usePermissions.ts**
   - Changed from using `user` to `profile`
   - Profile contains the role from database

3. **src/App.tsx**
   - Added loading state to wait for profile before rendering
   - Prevents sidebar from rendering before profile loads

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test as Admin User:
- Login with admin credentials
- You should see 15 menu items in sidebar:
  - Dashboard
  - Orders
  - Products
  - Inventory
  - Bulk Inventory
  - Delivery Agents
  - Stores
  - Categories
  - Coupons
  - Banners
  - Ratings
  - Support Tickets
  - Notifications
  - Analytics
  - Settings

- **Missing items** (Super Admin only):
  - Purchase Management
  - Inventory Adjustments
  - Payments
  - Refunds
  - Profit Analysis

- Try to access `/purchase-management` - should see "Access Denied"
- Try to access `/payments` - should see "Access Denied"
- Click logout - should successfully logout and return to login page

### 2. Test as Super Admin:
First, promote a user to super_admin:
```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'super_admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

Then login:
- You should see all 20 menu items
- All pages should be accessible
- No "Access Denied" errors

### 3. Test Logout:
- Click the logout icon in the header
- Should be logged out immediately
- Should redirect to login page
- Sidebar should disappear

## Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security:
1. **UI Layer**: Sidebar filters menu items based on permissions
2. **Route Layer**: ProtectedRoute shows "Access Denied" for unauthorized routes
3. **Component Layer**: Components check permissions and return null if unauthorized
4. **Database Layer**: RLS policies block unauthorized database queries

### Permission Flow:
```
Login → Fetch User from DB → Load Profile with Role →
Calculate Permissions → Filter Navigation → Render Sidebar
```

## Database Schema

### User Roles:
- `customer`: Regular customer
- `delivery_agent`: Delivery agent
- `admin`: Admin with limited access
- `super_admin`: Full access admin

### Restricted Tables (Super Admin Only):
- `payments` - Financial transaction data
- `refunds` - Refund records
- `inventory_adjustments` - Inventory adjustment audit trail

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Sidebar Still Empty After Login:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user exists in database: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email'`
3. Check user has valid role: role should be 'admin' or 'super_admin'
4. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Logout Not Working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify signOut function is being called
3. Check network tab for auth.signOut API call

### "Access Denied" for Admin Features:
This is expected behavior! Admin users should not have access to:
- Purchase Management
- Inventory Adjustments
- Payments
- Refunds
- Profit Analysis

To get access, you need to be promoted to super_admin role.

## Rollback Plan

If you need to revert these changes:

1. Revert `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to hardcoded admin role
2. Revert `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts` to use `user` instead of `profile`
3. Remove loading state from `src/App.tsx`
4. All users will have full admin access again

## Security Considerations

- User roles are stored in database and fetched on every login
- RLS policies enforce permissions at database level
- Even if frontend is bypassed, database blocks unauthorized access
- Logout clears all authentication state
- No sensitive data exposed in fallback profile

## Performance

- User profile is fetched once on login and cached in state
- Permissions are calculated once per profile change using useMemo
- Navigation filtering happens in memory (fast)
- No performance impact on page navigation
