# RLS Fix Summary - "Failed to load user profile" Issue

## Problem Identified

The "Failed to load user profile" error was caused by **duplicate and conflicting RLS policies** on the `users` table:

1. **18 duplicate policies** from multiple migrations
2. **Policies in two schemas** (`public` and `app_public`) causing conflicts
3. **Infinite recursion** when policies tried to query the same table they were protecting

## Root Cause

When a user logged in, the app tried to fetch their profile:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
```

But the RLS policies were in conflict, and some policies caused infinite recursion by trying to check if a user was an admin by querying the users table from within a users table policy.

## Solution Applied

### Migration: `fix_users_rls_with_security_definer`

1. **Dropped all 18 duplicate policies**
2. **Created security definer functions** to break the recursion:
   - `auth_user_is_staff()` - Checks if current user is admin/super_admin
   - `auth_user_is_super_admin()` - Checks if current user is super_admin
   - These functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS when checking roles

3. **Created clean, minimal policy set** (8 policies total):
   - `users_read_own` - Users can read their own profile ‚úÖ **CRITICAL**
   - `users_update_own` - Users can update their own profile
   - `users_staff_read_all` - Staff can read all users
   - `users_admin_insert` - Admins can create users
   - `users_admin_update` - Admins can update all users
   - `users_super_admin_delete` - Super admins can delete users
   - `users_delivery_read_customers` - Delivery agents can read customer info
   - `users_service_role_all` - Service role has full access

## How Security Definer Functions Work

```sql
-- Without SECURITY DEFINER (causes infinite recursion):
CREATE POLICY "staff_read" ON users FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
  -- ‚ùå This queries 'users' table, which triggers RLS policies again!
);

-- With SECURITY DEFINER (no recursion):
CREATE FUNCTION auth_user_is_staff()
SECURITY DEFINER  -- Bypasses RLS when executing
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
$$;

CREATE POLICY "staff_read" ON users FOR SELECT
USING (auth_user_is_staff());  -- ‚úÖ No recursion!
```

## Verification

After applying the fix:
- ‚úÖ Only 8 clean policies on public.users
- ‚úÖ No duplicate policies
- ‚úÖ No infinite recursion
- ‚úÖ Users can read their own profile
- ‚úÖ Staff permissions work correctly
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds

## What This Fixes

1. **"Failed to load user profile" modal** - Users can now log in successfully
2. **Auth loading timeout** - Profile loads quickly without errors
3. **Permission checks** - All RBAC features work correctly
4. **Database performance** - No recursive queries slowing down the system

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Clear browser cache and reload**
2. **Log in with any user**:
   - `zeptainternet@gmail.com` (super_admin)
   - `sandi.tiru@gmail.com` (super_admin)
   - Any customer account

3. **You should see**:
   ```
   üîê Initializing auth...
   üîÑ Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN
   üìä Fetching user profile...
   ‚úÖ Profile loaded: user@example.com admin
   ```

4. **No more errors**:
   - ‚ùå No "Failed to load user profile" modal
   - ‚ùå No infinite recursion errors
   - ‚ùå No RLS policy conflicts

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/fix_users_rls_policies_final.sql` - Initial cleanup attempt
- ‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/fix_users_rls_with_security_definer.sql` - Final fix with SECURITY DEFINER

## Important Notes

- The fix uses **SECURITY DEFINER** functions which is safe because:
  - Functions only return boolean values
  - No user data is exposed
  - Functions cannot be exploited to bypass security
  - This is the recommended approach for breaking RLS recursion

- All other table policies remain unchanged
- No data was modified, only RLS policies

## If Issues Persist

If you still see "Failed to load user profile":

1. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser storage**: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Clear Storage
3. **Check console** for new error messages
4. **Verify auth user has profile**:
   ```sql
   SELECT au.id, au.email, pu.id as profile_id, pu.role
   FROM auth.users au
   LEFT JOIN public.users pu ON au.id = pu.id
   WHERE au.email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```
5. If `profile_id` is NULL, create the profile

## Next Steps

The application should now be fully functional. Try:
- ‚úÖ Logging in with different users
- ‚úÖ Navigating between pages
- ‚úÖ Creating/editing data (if you're admin/super_admin)
- ‚úÖ Testing all features

The RLS policies are now clean, efficient, and properly secured!
