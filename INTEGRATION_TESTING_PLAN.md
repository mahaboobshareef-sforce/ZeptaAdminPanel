✅ Profit/loss calculations are accurate
✅ Inventory levels reflect final state
```

### **Scenario 2: Inventory Management Flow**

#### **Step 1: Purchase Recording (Admin)**
```
Test Steps:
1. Admin records bulk purchase (50kg potatoes)
2. System creates purchase record with batch number
3. Bulk inventory is updated automatically
4. Variant availability is calculated

Expected Results:
✅ Bulk inventory shows 50kg available
✅ Variant calculations show potential packets
✅ Purchase appears in purchase management
✅ Cost basis is recorded for FIFO
```

#### **Step 2: Stock Allocation (Admin)**
```
Test Steps:

2. Order is processed and delivered
3. Inventory is deducted using FIFO
4. Profit analysis is updated

Expected Results:
✅ Variant inventory: -10 packets
✅ Bulk inventory: -5kg from oldest batch
✅ Cost allocation: Uses FIFO pricing
✅ Profit calculation: Accurate margin analysis
```

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Store Operations**

#### **Test Multi-Store Workflow:**
```
Test Steps:
1. Customer in Guntur orders from Guntur store
2. Customer in Vijayawada orders from Vijayawada store
3. Each store has different inventory levels
4. Agents are assigned based on store proximity

Expected Results:
✅ Orders route to correct stores
✅ Inventory deducted from correct store
✅ Agents assigned from same store
✅ Profit analysis separated by store
```
